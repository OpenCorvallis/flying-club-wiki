The Flying Club @ Oregon State is a student-run organization that promotes general aviation within
Oregon State University and educates the community about general aviation issues. The Flying Club @
Oregon State maintains a relationship with the [Oregon State Flying Club][1], which owns several
planes that can be rented by its members.

This website serves as a general knowledge base for flying in Corvallis and the Pacific Northwest as
a whole, from how to get started on private pilot training to tips and tricks for more advanced
ratings. No matter your previous experience in aviation, the Flying Club @ Oregon State and Oregon
State Flying Club are here to help you achieve your flying goals!
